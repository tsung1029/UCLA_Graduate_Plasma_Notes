# UCLA_Graduate_Plasma_Notes

Just that, notes from the physics 222 course from the past

The 3 main notes are

Dawson + Gottlieb from Princeton  This was written originally in 1964 and was used in John's 1981 plasma physics course (Physics 222 a-c)

Dawson notes, circa 1990 (222 a-c)

Dawson notes for physics 215b.  

Fried + Nishikawa:  Fried & Nishikawa planned to write a book called "Modern Plasma Physics" but it was not published.  This folder contains a copy of it.

Morales:  This is my copy of the George Morales 222a-c, which was taught from 1980's to 2020.  Those of you who took it after I did would recognize my name as my homework became the solution for your homework assignments, I really tried to take build a good foundation for my plasma physics career and I hope it paid off.

Papers:  This folder are foundamental papers which were at the forefront of plasma physics at the time they were written but are extremely foundamental today.  (UPDATE June 2022:  Viktor Decyk has generously donated his archive of John Dawson papers and I will put them in a subfolder under this directory, mostly because John's thesis is in there and John Dawson did not start his career as a plasma physicist, which is hard to believe.)
